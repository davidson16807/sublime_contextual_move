# Sublime Contexual Move Keys
Ctrl+IJKL to move. Other keys toggle move behavior. You can move by characters, words, search results, history, and more.

## FAQ

###Why not Ctrl+WASD?
 Because Ctrl+S and Ctrl+A are some of the most widely adopted hotkeys of all time and I don't plan to remap their behavior.

###Why not Ctrl+HJKL?
 Because this is not vim. The vast majority of users are already familiar with the "inverse T" style of navigation, thanks largely to WASD and the regular arrow keys.
 
###Why not use Vim?
 See above. This is a plugin meant for mortals.
 
###Why not just extend behavior to the arrow keys?
 Because moving your hand interrupts your workflow. I want to keep both hands on the home row for as long as I can.
